      <p><em><a href="https://medium.com/airtree-venture/why-you-need-an-executive-coach-51a3e79cb176">Why you need an Executive Coach [4 min read]</a></em></p>
      <p>I’m here to provide the essential support entrepreneurs and new leaders need: encouragement, a reliable sounding board, honest self-reflection, and support in developing crucial leadership skills. I take a personalized and holistic approach to coaching, drawn from strengths-based psychology and my own hands-on experience in the startup trenches.</p>
      <p>I’ve guided leaders in building winning teams, inspiring and developing their employees, running effective meetings, public speaking, overcoming imposter syndrome, making confident decisions, navigating rejection, and ultimately fulfilling their full potential on their current journey and beyond.</p>
